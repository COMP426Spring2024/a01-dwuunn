                <p>The Tarot Club is a Newly Founded Secret Organization of Beyonders created by Klein Moretti aka The Fool in the palace above The Gray Fog. 
                    Initially, it started off as a gathering of three, Klein Moretti, Audrey Hall, and Alger Wilson, but has since expanded to 9 members. They each have different organizations backing them, allowing members to gather resources from various sources and advance at a rapid pace.</p>
                <p>Initially the Tarot Club was just a gathering of Low-Sequence Beyonders, but in the process of development and growth, the Tarot Club has unconsciously participated in many major historical events and become a powerful hidden organization that has attracted the attention of the world in less than 3 years since it founding.</p>
                <p>The Tarot Club first entered the public in the event of the Death of Lanevus, with tarot cards scattered all over the scene. It was officially recognized by the orthodox churches in Spring 1351, as a powerful secret organization that worshiped The Fool.</p>
                <p>The Tarot Club is in control of four Cards of Blasphemy: Black Emperor, Tyrant, Red Priest and The Fool. In addition, Mr. Fool had read the Second Blasphemy Slate.</p>
